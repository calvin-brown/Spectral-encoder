This repository explores autoencoders for compressing optical spectra

Typically, optical spectra are captured by a spectrometer and used to identify/quantify the presence of materials with known spectral features or peaks. In this project, we simulate spectra as combinations of Gaussian peaks and other simple waveforms. For sparse spectra, we hope that an autoencoder is able to learn a rather efficient representation, leading to a high rate of compression.
